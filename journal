Today we had our first lesson with computer science, with Dr Pinzon.
We started with a 3-step puzzle that we had to solve, and which introduced us breifly to computational thinking. 
It was quite challenging, yet fun because my team won.
I am excited to start learning more abour computer science, and actually getting an in depth look at important key concepts, compared to my previous lessons back home. 
It's also quite impressive the structure that Dr. Pinzon has created for the course, in regards to the website that he set up containing all the curriculum

Today we actually started the course, and dove straight into the first material (System fundamentals). We covered the topic of Systems in organisations, or more specifically "Planning and system installation". In addition we learnt about the terminal, and file organization at the core of our computers. It was fun to play around with the terminal, both navigating and actually interacting with your files (creating, modifying). So far this course has been quite interesting, and im very much looking forward to the next lessons.

Today we worked further in the terminal, and really dove deep into the bash programming language. It is quite complicated, and the syntax is horrible compared to my previous experience with f.ex. python.
We learnt about the mathematical operations, printing to the terminal and conditional statements.
I still wonder why are we learning this programming language? I feel it would be more useful to learn f.ex. python, but at the same time i understand that working with github will be quite important, and therefore we need the terminal to sync with the cloud.
