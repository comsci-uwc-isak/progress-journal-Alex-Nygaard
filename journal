Today we had our first lesson with computer science, with Dr Pinzon.
We started with a 3-step puzzle that we had to solve, and which introduced us breifly to computational thinking. 
It was quite challenging, yet fun because my team won.
I am excited to start learning more abour computer science, and actually getting an in depth look at important key concepts, compared to my previous lessons back home. 
It's also quite impressive the structure that Dr. Pinzon has created for the course, in regards to the website that he set up containing all the curriculum
